# 🎥 Classync Platform

Hey there! 👋 This is my final project for my web development course - a video review platform that I built from scratch. It's designed to help teachers and students collaborate better through video content with interactive feedback and commenting.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Frontend**: [https://class-review.netlify.app]
**Backend API**: [https://project-final-simon.onrender.com/]

## 🎯 What I was trying to solve

I noticed that when learning from videos, it's really hard to give specific feedback or ask questions about particular moments. Traditional video platforms just don't cut it for educational content. I wanted to build something that would let students and teachers have meaningful discussions about specific parts of videos, with time-coded comments and organized feedback.

## 💡 How I solved it

I built this platform that lets you:

- **Comment on specific video moments** - no more "around the 3-minute mark" confusion!
- **Organize everything by classes and projects** - keeps things tidy and easy to find
- **Have real conversations** - nested comments, replies, and likes make discussions feel natural
- **Switch between teacher and student views** - different interfaces for different needs
- **Use it on any device** - responsive design that works everywhere

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Styled Components** for component-based styling and theming
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions
- **Zustand** for lightweight state management (It is were all my fetches are)
- **React Router** for client-side routing and navigation
- **Vite** for fast development and building

### Backend Stuff

- **Node.js** with Express.js framework
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM for data persistence
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **JWT Authentication** with bcrypt for secure user management
- **Multer & Cloudinary** for file uploads and media management
- **Swagger** for API documentation

### Development Tools

- **ESLint** for code quality and consistency
- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **Git** for version control

## 🏗️ How I planned this thing

### My approach (as a student):

3. **Focused on user experience** - Made sure everything felt intuitive to use
4. **Tested on different devices** - Responsive design was a priority
5. **Kept it maintainable** - Used TypeScript and organized my code well

### Key decisions I made:

- **Component-based architecture** - Broke everything into reusable pieces
- **Separate state stores** - Different Zustand stores for classes, projects, comments, etc.
- **Protected routes** - Only logged-in users can access certain features
- **Mobile-first design** - Started with mobile and scaled up

## 🚀 Features

### 🎬 Video Management

- Upload videos and organize them by classes and projects
- Add time-coded comments at specific moments
- Video player with progress tracking and volume controls
- Generate thumbnails automatically

### 💬 Interactive Feedback System

- Comment threads that can have replies (and replies to replies!)
- Like/unlike comments and replies
- Comments are linked to specific video timestamps
- Rich text formatting for better communication

### 👥 User Management

- Secure login/signup with JWT tokens
- Different views for teachers vs. students
- User profiles and activity tracking
- Session management that actually works

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX

- Dark/light theme switching (because why not?)
- Responsive design that works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive navigation that doesn't confuse users

## 🏃‍♂️ How to get it running locally

### What you need:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB instance (I used MongoDB Atlas for free)
- npm or yarn

### Step by step:

1. **Clone my repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simonfrisk/classync-platform.git
   cd classync-platform
   ```

2. **Install backend stuff**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend stuff**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create `.env` files in both backend and frontend directories:

   **Backend (.env)**

   ```env
   MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost/classync
   PORT=8080
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

   **Frontend (.env)**

   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

5. **Start the servers**

   **Backend**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - API Docs: [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)
